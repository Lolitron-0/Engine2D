this project is abandoned and don't have proper interface (probably not working now even :)

This is my first game engine (kind of) attempt. The main idea is that it is C++ only (no scripting front-end or visual editor). I came up with idea of mix-in classes so we can use them in multi-inheritance such as:
`class Dino : public GameObject, PhysicBody, Collidable, EventListener`

But due to lack of planning (and upcoming exams) it was not (and won't be :) ) finished.
